    * Ian
        * Goals from the previous week
            * My specific goal from the previous week was to setup the Github backend repository, as well as research and begin implementing backend resources.
        * Progress and issues
            * Joselyn and I were able to successfully create our Github repository with a basic README.md file and folders.
               * One issue I ran into was figuring out what to include in the README.md file, but after looking at some templates online and from other repositories I was able to overcome this challenge.
            * Nathan and I began researching and experimenting with Node.js, Vercel and Flask.
               * There was a small learning curve in getting started with these technologies, but we were able to successfully figure them out and commit changes to the repository.
        * Goals for the next week
            * My goals for next week include designing a basic testing framework for retrieving data from the database.
               * This includes writing SQL query templates that can be further implemented later.
            * Another goal is to continue researching and implementing backend technologies.
