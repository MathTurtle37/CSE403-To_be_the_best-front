* Team Report
    * Goals from the previous week
        * Finish setting up and testing the database service through Aiven. (2 days; Fahad, Yassine)
        * Research backend frameworks and pick the one that we believe will be the most suitable. (1 day; Joselyn, Ian)
        * Start learning the chosen backend framework and learn how to connect it to the frontend (3 days; Joselyn, Ian)
        * Setup the test-automation framework infrastructure and CI service and add some initial tests. (3 days; everyone)
        * Create a basic UI for a Chrome extension (3 days; Jason, Daniel)
    * Progress and issues
        * We made progress on a few fronts for the project over the course of the past week. For example, we set up the database server on Aiven and have successfully managed to connect to it with a short Python program that created a test database and queried it. We also did some more research on backend frameworks and how to actually utilize them. For the frontend side of things we made some good progress as well and managed to actually inject some HTML into the Pokemon Showdown webpage and have a pop-up menu show up on the website itself.
    * Goals for the next week

        * Write some initial tests for each portion of the project (1 day; Everyone)

            * Setup the test-automation framework infrastructure and CI service and add some initial tests
        * Progress and issues
            * Since last week, I've found some text and video resources on Flask that I have started to look through.
                * A video I watched involved creating a Flask web application from scratch and deploying it online.
                * I've also been looking at the testing framework that Flask recommends and reading its documentation.
                * One conceptual issue that I have is connecting the Flask application to the services that we are using/are planning to use.
            *  I have also been looking through the backend repository and understanding the general purpose of the files in the repo
                * Since I am working on the documentation, which will be put onto our Vercel website, I am looking into HTML and CSS resources to help me edit the website to add and format the documentation. 
            *  I have started planning out backend tests
        * Goals for the next week
            * Look for and look through Flask, HTML, CSS, and Vercel resources (2 days)
                * Specifically, go through the GeeksForGeeks Flask, HTML, and CSS resources
            * After looking at Flask resources, start planning and implementing the backend (3 days)
    * Ian
        * Goals from the previous week
            * My specific goal from the previous week was to setup the Github backend repository, as well as research and begin implementing backend resources.
        * Progress and issues
            * Joselyn and I were able to successfully create our Github repository with a basic README.md file and folders.
               * One issue I ran into was figuring out what to include in the README.md file, but after looking at some templates online and from other repositories I was able to overcome this challenge.
            * Nathan and I began researching and experimenting with Node.js, Vercel and Flask.
               * There was a small learning curve in getting started with these technologies, but we were able to successfully figure them out and commit changes to the repository.
        * Goals for the next week
            * My goals for next week include designing a basic testing framework for retrieving data from the database.
               * This includes writing SQL query templates that can be further implemented later.
            * Another goal is to continue researching and implementing backend technologies.
    * Fahad
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Finish setting up and testing the database service through Aiven.
        * Progress and issues
            * I was able to get the database service set up through aiven and got some python code that allowed us to create a small test database and query it. A small issue is that it does not reflect these changes on the aiven website but it was able to do so on Yassine's end when he did it himself afterwards so it should not be a major issue.
        * Goals for the next week
            * Add some basic sample Pokemon information directly into the database (1 day)
            * Setup the tests for the database/webscraping part of the project (2 days)
            * Work on the program for the database that will web scrape the data we want from the website and put it into the database (3 days)
    * Yassine
