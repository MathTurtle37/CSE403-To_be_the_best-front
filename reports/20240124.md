# title: Weekly Status Report:

  Over the course of the past week, we have worked on things mostly related to the setup of the project and some research on how to approach it. We set up the git organization, with two repositories for the back and front ends.
The research we did included things like finding a good free service through which we can host a relational database on. Currently the forerunner for that is through a website known as aiven.io, through which we will try to use their
free version in order to be able to use a database with MySQL. Additionally, we also looked into backend frameworks since none of us really have experience with them. We are, however, still a little stuck on what backend framework is
the best to use and how to actually use a backend framework in the first place.
  The goals for next week are:
    - Finish setting up and testing the database service through Aiven. (2 days, Fahad)
    - Research backend frameworks and pick the one that we believe will be the most suitable. (3 days)
    - Setup the test-automation framework infrastructure and CI service and add some initial tests. (3 days, everyone)
